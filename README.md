# rock_paper_scissors_application

A new Flutter project.

this project is a simple rock paper scissors application to learn more about widgets and transfer data from screen to another screen and navigating between them.
in this project i learned that how stateful widget works and used setState and learned something about states.
i will upload more projects later and i will be better.
this helped me to get fluent on mading UI designs.
